# chronickidneydisease-prediction

This project focuses on the prediction and analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. CKD is a critical public health issue that can lead to severe health complications if not diagnosed and managed early. Through this project, we aim to provide insights into CKD data and develop predictive models to aid in early detection and intervention.
